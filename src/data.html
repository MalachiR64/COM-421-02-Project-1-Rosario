            <h1>How to Organize and Analyze Research Data</h1>
            <div>
                <p>This short lesson is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students undertaking original research projects. After completing the 30-minute lesson, you will be able to to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis</li>
                    <li>Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel</li>
                    <li>Prepare the document for statistical analysis in the software package PASW</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Format data for analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel installed. Open the document <a href="../docs/tutorial_spreadsheet.xlsx" download>ToolBox_DataLesson.xls</a> in Excel and follow along with the lesson, taking action as instructed.
                    In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered in the first row of each column.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Each variable name must be unique.</li>
                    <li>The first variable (in column A) should be a <span class="blue-text">unique identifier.</span></li>
                    <li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters), so change <i>4tutorial_types</i> to <i>tutorial_types</i>.</li>
                    <li>Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change <i>use</i>  and  <i>useful</i> to <i>perc_ease_of_use</i>  and  <i>perc_usefulness</i> , respectively</li>
                    <li>Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily apparent that Column F refers to <i>Perceived Usefulness</i>  and Column G refers to <i>Perceived Ease of Use</i>  .</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="../illustrations/datalesson_fig3.png" alt="fig3">
                <p class="caption">Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorical values have been formatted as dichotomous variables.</p>
                <p>Data values, or rows, have been input for each subject in the experiment.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Decide on input conventions and stick to them. In <i>gender</i> , change the "female" value to "F".</li>
                    <li>Separate data into component values whenever possible by adding new columns. For example, <i>tasks_completed</i>  values (Y/Y/N) can be broken up into three components. So, add columns <i>task1</i> , <i>task2</i>, and <i>task3</i>, and reformat values appropriately.</li>
                    <li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters).</li>
                    <li>Double-check to ensure no data entry errors have been made, then delete the old <i>tasks_completed</i>  column.</li>
                    <li>Your Raw_Dataset spreadsheet should now look like Figure 2.</li>

                    Replace categorical data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) to indicate whether or not the 
                    value is represented for the given subject/item. This makes the categorical values 
                    <span class="blue-text">dichotomous</span> , which gives the researcher maximum flexibility in testing for relationships or 
                    correlations.

                        <strong>Dichotomous variables allow for the easy isolation of characteristics for analysis. 
                        For example, separating experience levels allows the researcher to test in PASW 
                        whether subjects with low experience have perceived ease of use scores 
                        significantly different from those with medium and high experience levels.</strong>

                    <li>In the Formatted_Data sheet, add new columns with <strong>Insert > Columns</strong>  for each distinct value in categorical data columns ( <i>tutorial_types, gender, exp_level, task1, task2,</i>  and <i>task3</i> ). You do not have to add a new column for <i>task1, task2,</i>  and <i>task3</i>  because their values are already dichotomous.</li>
                    <li>Rename columns according to each possible categorical value. Copy and paste the values from the original column.</li>
                    <li>Replace dichotomous data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) using the replace function: <strong>Edit > Replace.</strong> </li>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, 
                        perc_enjoy is much higher on average than perc_usefulness, which also has a large 
                        variance. This suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the 
                        system useful even though they enjoyed using it.</strong>
                    </p>
                </aside>
                <p>
                    Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If 
                    necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, those with <span class="blue-text">continuous</span>  values, 
                    are adjacent. (In the spreadsheet, the continuous values of <i>perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness,</i> and 
                    <i>perc_ease_of_use</i> are already adjacent.) 
                    Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary, making sure not to 
                    include variable labels
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to <strong>Tools > Add-Ins...</strong> and make sure <strong>Analysis ToolPak</strong> is checked. Click OK</li>
                    <li> Go to <strong>Tools > Data Analysis</strong> and select <strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong>. Click OK</li>
                    <li>Enter the input range in the blank and check <strong>Summary Statistics</strong>. Click OK</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. Rename this spreadsheet 
                    Descriptive_Stats. Label the output according to the variables. For example, <i>Column 1</i> should 
                    be <i>perc_enjoy</i>. Your Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet should now look like Figure 4. 
                    Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising a dataset before running 
                    inferential statistics. What insights about the dataset can you glean from the summary statistics 
                    for <i>perc_usefulness</i> and <i>perc_ease_of_use</i>?
